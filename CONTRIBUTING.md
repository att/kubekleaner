## How to contribute

* Either log into GitHub or sign up for an [account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Create a branch from where you wish to base your contribution.
  * Usually, you will be working from a branch off of master.
* Make commits incrementally and logically as you add or change functionality.
* Try to limit unecessary whitespace by running `git diff --check` before you commit.
* Try to adhere to camelCase.
* Ensure that the MIT license is appropriately added to any new files.
