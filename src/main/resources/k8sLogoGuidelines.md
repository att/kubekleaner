# Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide you with guidance for using the Kubernetes logo. You
can use the logo on your website or in print without pre-approval, provided you
follow these basic guidelines.

You may display, modify, or use the Kubernetes logo only in connection with
compliant implementations of Kubernetes and related uses in the following ways.
A compliant implementation is an implementation of the unmodified Cloud Native
Compute Foundation (CNCF) 
version of Kubernetes found at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes and
compatible branches thereof, together with published specifications, APIs and
operational patterns.  Acceptable related uses include display, modification,
or use of the Kubernetes logo in connection with your compliant implementation,
your integration with a compliant implementation, your support for a compliant
implementation, your Kubernetes-compatible product, or in collateral,
presentations, and marketing materials relating to compliant implementations of
Kubernetes.

All other uses of this logo are covered by the Linux Foundation trademark
guidelines found [here](https://linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage).
